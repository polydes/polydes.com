  <summary>About Polydes - community extensions</summary>
  <p>
    Polydes is a collection of open source <a href="https://www.stencyl.com/">Stencyl</a> extensions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The name Polydes is a throwback to "Polyhedron Designs", a semi-official but short-lived Stencyl game production group from 2007 composed of community members. While a number of impressive Nintendo title knock-offs and original titles were lined up, I don't recall that any games were actually released.
  </p>
  <p>
    The community spirit of that group led me to reclaim the name. I'd like to view these extensions as the <i>Stencyl community's</i> extensions. That's why I packaged them all under the name Polydes, instead of using my own name.
  </p>
  <p>
    The source of the name also explains why the logo is a small stellated dodecahedron, a type of polyhedron.
